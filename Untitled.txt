1. Caesar Cipher
Theory:

One of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques.

Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

E.g., with a shift of 3: A → D, B → E, ..., X → A, Y → B, Z → C.

It is a monoalphabetic cipher, meaning each letter maps to one unique other letter.

2. Vigenère Cipher
Theory:

A polyalphabetic cipher, improving security over Caesar.

Uses a key (a word), where each letter in the key defines a Caesar shift for the corresponding letter in the text.

The key repeats itself if shorter than the text.

E.g., key = “LEMON”, text = “ATTACK”, would be encrypted using successive Caesar ciphers determined by L, E, M, O, N.

3. Playfair Cipher
Theory:

A digraph (pair of letters) substitution cipher.

Uses a 5x5 matrix filled with letters from a keyword, followed by the rest of the alphabet (I and J are usually combined).

Rules for encryption:

Same row: Replace each letter with the letter to its right.

Same column: Replace each letter with the one below it.

Rectangle: Replace letters with those at the opposite corners of the rectangle formed.

Padding with 'X' is added if there's an odd number of letters.

4. Hill Cipher
Theory:

A linear algebra-based cipher that encrypts blocks of text using matrix multiplication.

A square matrix (key) is multiplied with vectors of plaintext letters.

Uses modular arithmetic mod 26.

Decryption requires computing the modular inverse of the key matrix.

ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let’s walk through how DES (Data Encryption Standard) works in detail. It’s a classic block cipher and a great example of how symmetric encryption algorithms operate.

🔐 Overview: What is DES?
DES is a symmetric key block cipher developed by IBM in the 1970s and adopted as a federal standard by the NIST in 1977.

It encrypts data in blocks of 64 bits using a 56-bit key (plus 8 parity bits, making it 64 bits total).

DES performs 16 rounds of substitution and permutation (known as a Feistel network).

🧩 DES Architecture (Simplified)
🔄 Step-by-Step Working of DES:

Step	Operation	Description
1.	Initial Permutation (IP)	Reorders the 64-bit plaintext using a fixed permutation table.
2.	Split into Left and Right	The permuted data is split into two halves: L0 and R0, each 32 bits.
3.	16 Rounds of Feistel Cipher	Each round uses a subkey (derived from the main key). Operates like:
Li = Ri-1
Ri = Li-1 XOR F(Ri-1, Ki)
4.	Function F	Key part of each round. It does:
➤ Expansion of R (32 bits → 48 bits)
➤ XOR with 48-bit subkey
➤ Substitution using S-boxes
➤ Permutation
5.	Combine Final R and L	After 16 rounds, combine R16 and L16 (note they are swapped!)
6.	Final Permutation (FP)	Applies the inverse of the initial permutation (IP⁻¹) to get ciphertext.
🔄 Feistel Round (One Round in Detail)
Inputs:
32-bit Right Half (R)

48-bit Round Subkey (K)

Steps:
Expansion: Expand R from 32 to 48 bits using an expansion table.

XOR: XOR with the 48-bit subkey.

Substitution: Use 8 S-boxes, each replacing 6-bit input with a 4-bit output → total 32 bits.

Permutation: Apply a permutation to the 32 bits.

XOR with Left Half: This becomes the new right half.

🔑 Key Schedule (How Subkeys Are Made)
Start with a 64-bit key (only 56 bits are used; 8 bits are parity).

Apply permuted choice 1 (PC-1) to reduce it to 56 bits.

Split into two 28-bit halves.

For each round, rotate the halves and apply PC-2 to get a 48-bit subkey.

Rounds involve:

SubBytes (substitution)

ShiftRows (row-wise shifting)

MixColumns (column-wise mixing)

AddRoundKey (XOR with round key)

1. Modular Exponentiation (power function)
python
Copy
Edit
def power(base, expo, m):
    """Performs modular exponentiation."""
    res = 1
    base = base % m
    while expo > 0:
        if expo & 1:
            res = (res * base) % m
        base = (base * base) % m
        expo = expo // 2
    return res
This function performs modular exponentiation, which is essential for both encryption and decryption in RSA. It efficiently computes the result of (base^expo) % m using the method of exponentiation by squaring. This approach allows large exponents to be computed more efficiently in logarithmic time.

base % m ensures that the base is within the modulus m to prevent overflow.

The loop continuously squares the base and reduces the exponent by half, handling the odd/even exponents by multiplying the result when the exponent is odd (expo & 1).

2. Modular Inverse (modInverse function)
python
Copy
Edit
def modInverse(e, phi):
    for d in range(2, phi):
        if (e * d) % phi == 1:
            return d
    return -1
This function calculates the modular inverse of e modulo phi(n) (i.e., finding d such that (e * d) % phi(n) == 1). In the RSA algorithm, d is the private key, and it must satisfy the condition e * d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n)).

The function uses a brute-force method (looping through possible values of d) to find d. However, this can be slow for large numbers.

A more efficient approach, such as the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, can be used to find the modular inverse.

3. RSA Key Generation (generateKeys function)
python
Copy
Edit
def generateKeys():
    p = 7919  # Prime number 1
    q = 1009  # Prime number 2

    n = p * q
    phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)

    e = 0
    for e in range(2, phi):
        if gcd(e, phi) == 1:
            break

    d = modInverse(e, phi)

    return e, d, n
This function generates the public and private keys for RSA:

Prime numbers p and q: These are two large prime numbers that are chosen to calculate n. In this example, p is 7919 and q is 1009.

Modulus n: n is the product of p and q. This value is used in both the public and private keys.

Euler’s Totient Function φ(n): φ(n) is computed as (p-1) * (q-1), which is used to find the private key.

Public exponent e: This value is chosen such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) == 1. The code loops through possible values of e until it finds one that satisfies this condition.

Private exponent d: The value of d is computed using the modular inverse of e modulo φ(n).

The generated keys are returned as:

e (public exponent)

d (private exponent)

n (modulus)

4. Greatest Common Divisor (gcd function)
python
Copy
Edit
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD is used to check if two numbers are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1), which is an important step when selecting the public exponent e in the RSA algorithm.

5. Encryption (encrypt function)
python
Copy
Edit
def encrypt(m, e, n):
    return power(m, e, n)
This function performs the encryption of a message m using the public key (e, n). The encryption process is simply computing the modular exponentiation of the message with the public exponent e and modulus n.

The result C is the encrypted ciphertext.

6. Decryption (decrypt function)
python
Copy
Edit
def decrypt(c, d, n):
    return power(c, d, n)
This function decrypts the ciphertext c using the private key (d, n). The decryption process is similar to encryption but uses the private exponent d instead of e.

The result m is the decrypted message

Detailed Explanation of the Code
This Python program demonstrates the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) using the pycryptodome library for cryptographic operations. It allows users to generate key pairs, sign messages, and verify signatures using DSA. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Dependencies:
The program uses the pycryptodome library, which is a cryptography package that provides various cryptographic functionalities, including key generation, hashing, and signing.

The key modules used are:

Crypto.PublicKey.DSA: Handles the DSA key generation and key import/export.

Crypto.Hash.SHA256: Implements the SHA-256 hash function.

Crypto.Signature.DSS: Implements the DSA signing and verification methods.

Crypto.Random.get_random_bytes: Provides a secure random number generator for cryptographic operations.

binascii: Used to convert binary data (like signatures) into readable hexadecimal format.

2. Key Generation:
Function generate_keys:

This function generates a DSA key pair using the DSA.generate(2048) method, where 2048 is the bit-length of the keys (stronger security with larger key sizes).

The generated keys are then exported using export_key(), which returns the private key and public key in a format that can be stored or transmitted.

The function prints a success message and returns the private and public keys.

python
Copy
Edit
key = DSA.generate(2048)  # Generate a 2048-bit DSA key pair
private_key = key.export_key()  # Export private key
public_key = key.publickey().export_key()  # Export public key
3. Signature Generation:
Function generate_signature:

This function signs a message using a private key.

It first imports the private key using DSA.import_key(private_key).

Then it creates a DSS.new signer object, which is used to sign the message.

The message is hashed using SHA-256 (SHA256.new(message.encode())), which produces a fixed-length 256-bit digest of the message.

The signer.sign(h) method signs the hash of the message, and the signature is returned in hexadecimal format for readability.

python
Copy
Edit
signer = DSS.new(key, 'fips-186-3')  # Standard DSS for signing
h = SHA256.new(message.encode())  # Hash the message with SHA-256
signature = signer.sign(h)  # Sign the hashed message
4. Signature Verification:
Function verify_signature:

This function verifies the authenticity of a signature using the public key.

It imports the public key using DSA.import_key(public_key).

A DSS.new verifier object is created.

The message is hashed again with SHA-256 and the signature is checked with verifier.verify(h, signature).

If the verification is successful, it prints "Signature is valid", otherwise, it prints "Signature is invalid".

python
Copy
Edit
verifier = DSS.new(key, 'fips-186-3')  # Standard DSS for verification
h = SHA256.new(message.encode())  # Hash the message with SHA-256
verifier.verify(h, signature)  # Verify the signature
5. Menu-Driven Program:
Function menu:

This function provides a menu for the user to interact with the program.

The options allow users to:

Generate a key pair (private and public keys).

Sign a message with the private key.

Verify the signature using the public key.

Exit the program.

The program ensures that the keys are generated before signing a message, and a message is signed before verifying the signature.

If invalid input is provided, it prompts the user to take the correct action.

6. Main Execution Block:

This allows users to interact with the system and perform key generation, signing, and verification operations.

SHA-256 Explained in Detail
SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) as part of the SHA-2 family of hash functions. It is widely used in various security applications and protocols.

Key Features of SHA-256:
Fixed Output Length:

Regardless of the size of the input, the output (hash) length is always 256 bits (32 bytes).

This makes SHA-256 useful for verifying data integrity, as a hash of the original message will always produce the same length.

Deterministic:

The same input will always produce the same hash output, making it useful for data verification and comparison.

Pre-image Resistance:

Given a hash value, it is computationally infeasible to find the original input data that produced the hash. This property ensures that the hash is secure and not reversible.

Collision Resistance:

It is extremely unlikely that two different inputs will produce the same hash output. This makes SHA-256 resistant to hash collisions, ensuring the uniqueness of the hash.

Efficient Computation:

SHA-256 is computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications like blockchain and digital signatures.

Used in Digital Signatures:

In digital signature algorithms like DSA and RSA, SHA-256 is used to hash the message before signing it. This ensures that the signature corresponds to the actual content of the message.

SHA-256 Process:
Message Padding:

The input message is padded to make its length a multiple of 512 bits. Padding involves adding a 1 bit, followed by a series of 0 bits, and the length of the original message (in bits).

Message Parsing:

The padded message is broken into 512-bit blocks. Each block is processed sequentially.

Initial Hash Values:

SHA-256 uses eight initial hash values (constant values derived from the fractional parts of the square roots of the first eight prime numbers).

Compression Function:

Each 512-bit message block is processed by a series of bitwise operations, including logical functions (AND, OR, XOR) and modular additions. The result is fed into the next block.

Final Hash Output:

After processing all blocks, the final hash value is obtained by concatenating the eight intermediate hash values.

In Python, SHA-256 is implemented as part of the hashlib library or through specialized libraries like pycryptodome for cryptographic applications.

Edit
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256

h = SHA256.new(message.encode())  # Hash the message using SHA-256
This generates the SHA-256 hash of the message, which is used in signing and verifying digital signatures.

Summary:
Key Generation: Generates a public-private key pair using DSA.

Signature Generation: Signs a message with the private key using SHA-256.

Signature Verification: Verifies the authenticity of a signature using the public key.

SHA-256: A cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit hash from input data, ensuring data integrity and security in operations like digital signatures.
